First, test on just one episode (IV)

REASON:
- Sequels are notoriously tricky to write
- Star Wars is a great *series* (more data)
- Help improve moviemaking pipeline
- I was inspired by Shakespeare NN
- I am a huge fan of SW and films in general
- NEXT -> TV episode generator

MODEL:
- One script: 192 epochs -> 0.1390 LOSS
- ADD accuracy measurement (do we actually need accuracy?)
- ADD accuracy and loss plots (bci-nn.py)
